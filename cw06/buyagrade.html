			Life itself is your professor, and you are in a state of constant learning, now there are 3 kinds of people in the world: people that can count and people that can't count. Which of the three are you?.  That's right!  All you need to get a 4.0 in this course. My education is about learning what you didn't know even if know you that didn't know. <br/><br/>
